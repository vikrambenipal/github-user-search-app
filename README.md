# Github Users Search App
## Built using React.js, Styled Components, Github API 

This app enables users to search for any github user and will have all of their information displayed. 
The app also comes with a light/dark mode toggle.

## Learning 
I enjoyed the CSS challenge of creating a custom search bar with the 'Search' button inside the input field. I also enjoyed using the Github API to collect the public data of users.
